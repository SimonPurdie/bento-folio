# Project Brief: Simon Purdie's Data Analysis Portfolio

## 1. Professional Identity & Narrative
Simon is a **Data Analyst** with a rich background in **IT Systems Management** (6+ years at the Royal Courts of Justice) and a secondary career in **Graphic Design** and **Performance Art** (Fire/Hula Hoop). 

His "story" is one of a lifelong computer enthusiast (starting with an Acorn Electron in 1985) who combines deep technical expertise with the ability to communicate complex insights to non-technical stakeholders (e.g., senior judges).

### Key Strengths
- **Technical Depth**: Building AI agents from scratch (`Miyori`), high-level process automation, and data scraping/analysis.
- **Communication**: Translating technical complexity into actionable stories—a skill honed in high-pressure legal environments.
- **Design Sensibility**: A background in graphic design and a clear vision for modern, premium-feeling digital experiences.

## 2. Technical Profile
Simon is "highly technologically adept," as evidenced by his recent projects:

- **AI/Agentic Workflows**: `Miyori` (modular AI agent, custom memory systems), `workhunter` (agent-oriented job search environment).
- **Data Engineering & Analysis**: `VS-Code-PR-Analysis` (GraphQL extraction, semantic analysis of PR patterns, Power BI visualization).
- **Languages/Tools**: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), SQL, Power BI, Tableau, GraphQL, Lua.
- **Modern Dev Stacks**: Experienced with Astro, Tailwind, and GitHub Pages for deployment. Also experienced with C++ and Java.
- **Current Methodology**: Primarily focuses on orchestrating **AI Coding Agents** and high-level design, minimizing manual coding.

## 3. Design Vision
The portfolio needs to "WOW" the visitor with a premium, state-of-the-art aesthetic that stands out from generic developer sites.

- **Layout**: Modern **Bento-box** grid with asymmetric card sizing and visual hierarchy.
- **Aesthetic**: 
    - **Muted & Warm**: Mid-low chroma palette (creams, warm grays, muted terracottas, sage greens).
    - **Soft & Modern**: `rounded-3xl` corners, subtle shadows, and generous whitespace.
    - **Interactive**: Subtle hover lifts (tactile feel).
- **Focus**: Insights and business impact. The portfolio should showcase *data stories*, not just code snippets.

---

## 4. Content Strategy
- **Hero Card**: Establish personality and expertise (2-3 sentences).
- **Project Cards**: 2-4 key analyses (e.g., VS Code PR Analysis, Miyori). Focus on the "Why" and the "So What."
- **Tech Stack**: Proficiency in languages (Python, SQL), visualization (Power BI, Tableau), and agentic workflows.
- **Optional**: Mini interactive charts (D3/Observable), GitHub stats (understated).

---

## 5. Technical Requirements
- **Framework**: Astro 5.0
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages (Static site)
- **Maintainability**: Project data managed in `projects.json` or `projects.ts` for type-safe, easy updates.
- **Responsive**: Single-column collapse with maintained readability and spacing.

---

## 6. Success Criteria
1. **First Impression**: A "WOW" design that feels premium and welcoming.
2. **Clarity**: Immediately communicates Simon's unique value proposition (Data + IT Leadership + Design).
3. **Utility**: Fast-loading, responsive, and easy to maintain.
4. **Differentiation**: Leverages multimodal strengths to highlight sophisticated analysis and spatial reasoning.
